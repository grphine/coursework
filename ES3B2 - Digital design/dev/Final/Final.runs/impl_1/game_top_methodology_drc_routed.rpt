Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock clock_gen_inst/clk_wiz_instance/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin clock_gen_inst/clk_wiz_instance/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins

CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net clk_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): clk_IBUF_inst/O, clock_gen_inst/clk, seg_inst/clk
