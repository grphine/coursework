              deficiency to enable accurate interpretation of scientific data},

  abstract = {Color vision deficiency (CVD) affects more than 4\% of the
              population and leads to a different visual perception of colors.
              Though this has been known for decades, colormaps with many
              colors across the visual spectra are often used to represent
              data, leading to the potential for misinterpretation or
              difficulty with interpretation by someone with this deficiency.
              Until the creation of the module presented here, there were no
              colormaps mathematically optimized for CVD using modern color
              appearance models. While there have been some attempts to make
              aesthetically pleasing or subjectively tolerable colormaps for
              those with CVD, our goal was to make optimized colormaps for the
              most accurate perception of scientific data by as many viewers as
              possible. We developed a Python module, cmaputil, to create
              CVD-optimized colormaps, which imports colormaps and modifies
              them to be perceptually uniform in CVD-safe colorspace while
              linearizing and maximizing the brightness range. The module is
              made available to the science community to enable others to
              easily create their own CVD-optimized colormaps. Here, we present
              an example CVD-optimized colormap created with this module that
              is optimized for viewing by those without a CVD as well as those
              with red-green colorblindness. This colormap, cividis, enables
              nearly-identical visual-data interpretation to both groups, is
              perceptually uniform in hue and brightness, and increases in
              brightness linearly.},
