## ES3B2 - Digital design

Result - pending 

Design assignment - develop an interactive game on a Nexys 4DDR FPGA board. 10 page report, including code appendicies.
- Through the practical use of the Verilog hardware description language (HDL), consolidate
understanding of the theory of combinational and sequential circuits and how these
combine in the design of digital computing circuits.
